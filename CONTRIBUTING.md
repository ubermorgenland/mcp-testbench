## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Node.js (for testing stdio MCP servers)
- Docker (optional, for Docker mode testing)

### Install for Development
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone git@github.com:ubermorgenland/mcp-testbench.git
cd mcp-testbench

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run tests
python cli.py run --stdio "npx time-mcp"
```

## Code Style

### Python
- Follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) style guide
- Use meaningful variable names
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Use type hints where appropriate

### Example:
```python
async def run_test(client: httpx.AsyncClient) -> dict:
    """Run security test against MCP server.

    Args:
        client: HTTP client for making requests

    Returns:
        Dictionary with test results
    """
    response = await client.get("/")
    return {"status": "completed"}
```

### Documentation
- Add docstrings to all public functions
- Update README if adding new features
- Include examples in docstrings

## Plugin Development

Want to add a new security test? Create a plugin!

### Plugin Structure
```python
# plugins/my_plugin.py
from engine import Plugin
import httpx

class MyPlugin(Plugin):
    """Description of what this plugin tests."""

    async def run(self, client: httpx.AsyncClient) -> dict:
        """Run the security test.

        Args:
            client: HTTP client for requests

        Returns:
            dict: Test results with 'status' and findings
        """
        # Your test logic here
        return {
            "status": "completed",
            "vulnerabilities_found": 0,
            "risk_level": "LOW"
        }
```

### Plugin Guidelines
- One plugin = one security concern
- Return consistent JSON structure
- Include `risk_level`: NONE, LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL
- Add tests for your plugin
- Document what the plugin checks

## Testing Guidelines

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Test stdio mode
python cli.py run --stdio "npx time-mcp" --verbose

# Test HTTP mode
python cli.py run http://localhost:8000 --verbose

# Test Docker mode (if applicable)
python cli.py run --docker --docker-path ./test-server
```

### What to Test
- âœ… Plugin discovers and runs successfully
- âœ… Handles errors gracefully
- âœ… Generates valid JSON report
- âœ… Security badge is created
- âœ… No crashes on edge cases

## Pull Request Guidelines

### PR Title Format
```
Add: Feature description
Fix: Bug description
Update: Documentation/refactor description
```

### PR Description Should Include
- **What**: What does this PR do?
- **Why**: Why is this change needed?
- **How**: How does it work?
- **Testing**: How did you test this?
- **Screenshots**: If UI changes (for docs/reports)

### Example PR Description
```markdown
## What
Adds rate limiting detection plugin to identify MCP servers without rate limits.

## Why
Rate limiting is a common security concern. This helps developers identify if their server is vulnerable to DoS attacks.

## How
- New plugin: `plugins/rate_limiter.py`
- Sends 100 requests in 1 second
- Checks if any are rejected/throttled
- Reports risk level based on results

## Testing
- Tested against time-mcp (no rate limiting detected - MEDIUM risk)
- Tested against mock server with rate limits (correctly detected - LOW risk)
- All existing tests still pass
```
